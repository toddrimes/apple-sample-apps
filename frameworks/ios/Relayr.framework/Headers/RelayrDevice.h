/*!
 *  @abstract An instance of this class represents a Device. A basic relayr entity
 *	@discussion A device is any external entity capable of producing measurements and sending them to a transmitter to be further sent to the relayr cloud, or one which is capable of receiving information from the relayr platform. 
 *	Examples would be a thermometer, a gyroscope or an infrared sensor.
 *
 *  All RelayrSDK objects (except when explicitly said otherwise) will return the same instance when copied (e.g.: when added to a dictionary). Thus the <code>NSCopying</code> method <code>-copyWithZone:</code> will return the same instance. Same happening with <code>NSMutableCopying</code> method <code>-mutableCopyWithZone:</code>.
